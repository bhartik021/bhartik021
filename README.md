## About Me

🎓 I'm an engineering undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering at RTU, Kota. Currently, I hold the role of a Technical Writer at Scaler.

👩🏻‍💻 Previously, I gained valuable experience as a web development intern at HappyAgility.com and Artyvis. I also hold an engineering diploma (Honors) focusing on computer science and engineering.

💡 Throughout my academic journey, I've built numerous mid-level projects, showcasing my proficiency in full-stack web development (MERN stack). I am also well-versed in data structures and algorithms (C++).

👩🏻‍💻 I actively contribute to the open-source community and serve as a mentor at GSSoC (GirlScript Summer of Code), guiding and supporting aspiring developers in their open-source projects.

🏆 I'm proud to have participated in the prestigious 'Samsung Solve For Tomorrow Challenge', where my team was selected among the top 50 teams across India. This experience sharpened my collaborative skills and exposed me to real-world challenges. Also, I have been selected for Amazon ML Summer School in 2023.

🌟 In addition to my technical pursuits, I have been Lead at GFG Student Chapter RTU, fostering a community of aspiring programmers. Moreover, I am a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, contributing to the field of technology. Also, I am a MongoDB Community Creator and HackerEarth Campus Ambassador.
