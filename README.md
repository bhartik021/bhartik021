## About Me

### 🎓 Education

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at RTU, Kota. Additionally, I hold an engineering diploma (with Honors) specializing in computer science and engineering.

### 💼 Experience

I've had the privilege of interning as a web developer at HappyAgility.com and Artyvis, where I honed my skills in frontend and backend development. Currently, I'm leveraging my technical expertise as a Technical Writer at Scaler, contributing to the dissemination of knowledge in the tech community.

### 🚀 Skills

My journey in the tech world has equipped me with proficiency in a wide array of tools and technologies. From crafting elegant user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building robust backend systems with Node.js and Express, I thrive in every aspect of the development cycle. My familiarity with databases like MongoDB and MySQL allows me to create scalable and efficient solutions.

### 🌱 Open Source and Community

I'm a strong advocate for open-source software and actively contribute to various projects. As a mentor at GSSoC (GirlScript Summer of Code), I guide aspiring developers and support them in their open-source endeavors. I also take pride in being part of initiatives like the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow Challenge and Amazon ML Summer School, where I collaborate with talented individuals to tackle real-world challenges.

### 🌟 Passion and Vision

Beyond coding, I'm deeply passionate about leveraging technology for social good. Whether it's organizing tech workshops for underprivileged students or participating in hackathons focused on sustainability, I believe in using my skills to make a positive impact on society.
